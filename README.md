# spark-jython-udf

This is an initial attempt at a spark package that captures the core concepts from
[SPARK-15369](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13571) and attempts to turn that into 
an installable spark-package.

## Thanks

This would not have been possible without the considerable efforts of @holdenk pushing 
python forward in the Apache Spark community
